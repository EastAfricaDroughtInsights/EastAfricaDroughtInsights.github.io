<li> Kenya Red Cross had worked with IFRC to put together a plan of action in 2015; this plan provided a basis for the 2016/17 response, and allowed for quick planning and resource mobilization.</li>
<br><li> Kenya Red Cross branches in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), developed county contingency plans with county governments, in preparation for the forecasted drought, which allowed them to respond faster and more effectively.</li>
<br><li> In early 2016, KRCS prepared for drought through capacity building of the RCAT and National Disaster Response Team (NDRT). Training included conducting rapid assessments using the Kenya Inter-Agency Rapid Assessment (KIRA) tool, monitoring of drought situations and putting in place contingency plans. The KRCS developed the response tools; Document Management Framework (the hierarchy of documents); SoPs for drought and RCAT guidelines. These were critical during response, making response organized and well-coordinated.</li>
