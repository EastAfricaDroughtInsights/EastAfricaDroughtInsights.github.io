                            Over the last year, the International Center for Humanitarian Affairs (ICHA), supported by British Red Cross and other Movement partners, have been carrying out research into the 2016-17 drought crisis in East Africa, and how the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement responded.

                            By speaking to dozens of people, and reviewing hundreds of documents, the research (which can be read in full <a href="ICHA Research Report - How the RCRC Mvoement Responded to the East Africa drought.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) has led to a series of insights about how National Societies and Movement partners can better prepare for, and respond to, future drought events.

Somalia pooled their resources and shared information, which led to minimal duplication in the same areas of intervention. In Somalia the cluster coordination worked well at 'meetings level' (if not operational level due to low capacity local organisations).

These were critical during response, making response organized and well-coordinated.

For example, at the global level through the EWEA Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, critical situations are flagged quarterly, and this information is used to provide recommendations on early action in agriculture and food security.

In Kenya, places where preparedness activities involved building and repairing infrastructures such as boreholes and clinics, showed higher absorption rates in terms of dealing with the shocks, than areas that did not have resilience projects.

                        <p class="text-small">It is evident from the findings that response to drought using cash worked well in most parts, thus this can be enhanced by using cash as a preparedness modality before drought strikes. Leveraging on the existing social protection programmes such as the Hunger Safety Net in Kenya which operates in drought prone areas and has experience in scaling up additional recipients in drought emergencies, National Societies can help scale up cash transfers to reduce or manage human and economic losses as a result of drought through the delivering of cash before disaster as a social protection measure while using these programmes as scalable platforms that can support people affected by drought more effectively
